# ✈️ Flight Delay Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Flight delays are a significant challenge in global air travel, affecting passenger experience and airline operations. This project aims to analyze historical flight data to uncover key delay patterns and develop predictive models that assist airlines in minimizing controllable delays and improving operational efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Uncover Hidden Patterns**: Perform in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to detect trends, correlations, and causes of delays.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build machine learning models to:
  - Predict if a flight will be delayed (Yes/No)
  - Estimate the delay duration (in minutes)
- **Operational Focus**: Use a custom metric — *Operational Adjustability Index (OAI)* — to prioritize controllable delays over uncontrollable ones.
- **Explainable AI**: Apply SHAP values to interpret predictions and provide clarity on influential delay factors.

## 📊 Deliverables
- **📁 EDA Report**: Visualizations and insights into delay patterns by day, time, season, and carrier.
- **🤖 ML Models**: Classification and regression models trained on the flight delay dataset.
- **📈 Model Evaluation**:
  - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC
  - Regression: MAE, RMSE
- **🧮 SHAP Interpretability**: Feature-wise breakdown of model decisions using SHAP values.
- **🛫 Actionable Recommendations**: Practical suggestions for airlines to improve schedules, operations, and communication.
- **🧑‍💻 Codebase**: Well-organized, commented Jupyter notebooks.
